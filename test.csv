9148,"@handle -- To answer your D/ST question, you really can't lose with either NO or BALT ... both are playing HORRIBLE TEAMS (go w/ Ravens)"
9148,@handle -- Titans rookie WR Kenny Britt may be a great Gage replacement -- and a better alternative to T.O. at this point ...
9148,"@handle -- No worries. Those 3 rants were not intended for anyone in particular ... I just hate defensive questions, in general ..."
9148,"@handle -- I would not drop Donald Brown for ANY Redskin right now ... unless you REALLY A NEED a 4th-string WR, hold on to D-Brown"
9148,Here are today's Thursday Revelations/Fantasy Clicks ... enjoy! http://tinyurl.com/yj4cqwe
9148,"@handle -- Change of plans: Justin Gage has ""multiple"" broken bones in his back ... you might wanna NOT pick him up for the time being ..."
9148,@handle -- Then go Brady over Peyton ...
9148,@handle -- I'd rank your WRs 1)Austin 2)Jennings 3)Holmes 4)Boldin for Week 10 ... thx!
9148,"@handle -- Do you actually have Peyton AND Brady? If so, does it really matter?"
9148,@handle -- Celek over V-Davis (barely) ... thx!
9148,"@handle -- I'd rather have LT/Crabtree over D-Jax, if that's what you're asking ... (but it's very, very close)"
9148,"@handle -- If you REALLY want AP, you'll have to surrender 1 Tier 1 RB/1 Tier 1 WR/1 Tier 2 RB/WR ... it's got to be a 3-for-1"
9148,@handle -- You ride Ronnie and Forte in Week 10 ... unless you know for sure Westbrook won't play (and we don't know that as of Thursday)
9148,"@handle -- I'd start Dustin Keller over Heap in Week 10 ... in fact, I have that exact same scenario in one of my 10 leagues ... thx!"
9148,"@handle -- If T.O. is the worst WR on your roster, then dump him for Gage ... and I'd drop Felix's balky knee over Choice to get Betts"
9148,@handle -- I shouldn't be disrespecting Cedric -- who's been amazing this year -- but I think Mendenhall has a better game in Week 10
9148,"@handle -- For your two flex spots, let's ride Welker and SidRice over Witten, V-Davis, M-Barber and Reggie Bush .. thx!"
9148,@handle -- I'd start Calvin over Boldin in Week 10 ...
9148,"@handle -- WITHOUT knowing who's on your team or which twosome you'd be getting ... I'd rather have AP/Palmer over Peyton/K-Smith, thx!"
9148,"@handle -- Your ""should I dump Calvin"" is wayyyy too vague ... who else ya got? Me personally, I am going to ride him every week ..."
9148,"@handle -- OH, HOW I LOVE ANSWERING DEFENSIVE QUESTIONS ... WHAT FUN!!!! Sarcasm aside, Bengals long-term ... Fins this week!"
9148,For those who haven't read today's Clicks ... I cover rankings for QBs/RBs/WRs/TEs ... http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148,@handle -- Use your RB depth to make trades ... slaton to moats' owner ... mccoy to westbrook's ... sell Portis/ & Betts ... BE CREATIVE!
9148,"@handle -- Part 1 -- I'd start Romo over Cutler (barely) ... Part 2 -- Yes, drop Knox for Greene ..."
9148,@handle -- V-Davis ... http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/fantasy/11/11/wednesday.clicks/index.html
9148,Here are today's Fantasy Clicks -- literally HOT OFF THE PRESSES!!!! http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148,"@handle -- Eh, I'd probably want the Palmer/Jennings end -- but it's close!"
9148,@handle -- I just sent 'em to New York ... which means they'll probably be on the site by 3 p.m. ... thx!
9148,"@handle -- Once again, I'm not a big fan of vague questions ... what are your other options, should you choose to dump Portis?"
9148,@handle -- I would rather have Mendenhall/Bowe over Carolina's Steve Smith/P-Thomas ... due to the Chiefs' easy-cheesy sked coming up
9148,"@handle -- Yes, I would definitely surrender Palmer for Addai -- in a nanosecond! ... as for your RBs, start Peterson and Beanie ..."
9148,"@handle -- With your current roster, I would most certainly give up P-Rivers to get back CedBenson/Carson in return ... boom!"
9148,@handle -- I'd rank your RBs like this for Week 10 -- 1)J-Stew 2)Hightower 3)Fargas 4)F-Jackson ... thx!
9148,@handle -- It's not a blowout ... but I'd rather have Fitz/Felix over Wayne/Reggie Bush in a standard-scoring league ... PPR? maybe not
9148,"@handle -- Dude, did you seriously ask if you should dump an extra kicker for darren sproles? I oughta ban you from here for asking that"
9148,"@handle -- For Gates/Flacco in a keeper ... you'd probably get someone like ryan grant, p-thomas, mendenhall, knowshone, LT, barber, etc."
9148,@handle -- That question is too broad ... I need specifics to your personal situation...
9148,@handle -- I will NEVER pass up a chance to improve my team before the deadline (no exceptions) ... but I could be happy with your RBs ..
9148,"@handle -- Uh, Fitz and the Cards have the easiest playoff-sked BY A COUNTRY MILE ... l'd side with Larry ..."
9148,"@handle -- That's rather vague ... do I like him as a No. 4 RB? yes ... a No. 2? no ... would I kill myself to trade for him? Uh, no ..."
9148,Here are the fantasyland Week 11 Revelations -- hot off the presses! (will re-post later for non-early risers) ... http://twurl.nl/a0o037
9148,@handle -- You are very welcome ... I appreciate the patronage!
9148,@handle -- Not eve Maroney or Slaton family members would pick their kin over Ray Rice and T-Jones in Week 11. ... there's your answer
9148,"@handle -- If you want to go safe at the flex, go with 1)Charles 2)Burleson 3)Chambers ... if it's feast-or-famine, let's ride D-Mac .."
9148,"@handle -- Looks to me like you've ALREADY decided to take that trade ... but yes, I'd rather have Ocho/Beanie over Addai/Cribbs"
9148,"@handle -- Boldin, Rice and Calvin ... thx!"
9148,"@handle -- I'm not thinking of Week 12, my man ... we'll address later"
9148,"@handle -- This is wayyyyyyyyyy too vague a question, my man ... should he be starting for you, that's all that matters????"
9148,@handle -- As for your WRS ... let's ride Driver and Steve Smith ... thx!
9148,"@handle -- Honestly, I think I'd rather take my chances on Devery Henderson ... but if I had to choose, I would probably go B-Marsh ..."
9148,"@handle -- Ummmm, I'd go with Sims-Walker over Hightower for your PPR in Week 11 ... thx!"
9148,"@handle -- I'd go Beanie over Lynch/LJ at RB ... at WR, let's ride Boldin & V-Jax over T.O., Braylon, Walter ... and thx for the patronage!"
9148,"@handle -- I have lost complete confidence in Lynch (so much that F-Jax is probably better ... but in your case, let's ride McCoy/MB3"
9148,@handle -- It' s your lineup and your money. Ride that hunch!
9148,"@handle -- If you absolutely, positively need a home run at the flex for Week 11 ... let's ride Devery over M-Bush, Fargas, Felix, Bryant"
9148,"@handle -- Oh goody, a defense question ... woo-hoo!!!! I'm taking the Saints, simply because NO has the more opportunistic D ..."
9148,"@handle -- SInce you had no follow-up questions from before, I will assume you liked Friday's Clicks ... thx for the patronage, as always!"
9148,"@handle -- Wow! When push comes to shove, I'm always starting Rodgers @ home (in good weather) ... and let's ride Austin at the WR slot"
9148,"@handle -- Shouldn't you be asleep by now? GameDay starts in, what, 6 hours!!! Damn!"
9148,"@handle -- For Week 11, I'd rank your flex RBs like this: 1)McCoy 2)F-Jax 3)Betts 4)Forsett ... although it's razor-thin between all 4 ..."
9148,@handle -- I would rank 'em in the exact order you wrote: 1)Mendenhall 2) SidRice 3)Jacobs 4)Steve Smith (NYG) and 5)B-Scott for Week 11
9148,"@handle -- First of all, you can't go wrong either way ... both are locks for 275 yards and/or 3 TDs ... but I'd play Warner over Brady!"
9148,"@handle -- For your PPR, I'd rank your Week 11 WRs like this: 1)Moss 2)Rice 3)Housh 4)Holmes 5)Burleson ... thx!"
9148,@handle -- I'd rather have Hasselbeck over Palmer (barely) ... either one would be an upgrade though
9148,@handle -- I've been condemning Flacco for a while ... given the Ravens' Rice-reliance and the upcoming slate of cold-weather games
9148,"@handle -- What? Are you saying that you ask the same question to 4-5 different ""experts"" every week? Sacre bleu! (Seriously ... thx!)"
9148,"@handle -- For your flex option, I'd go 1)McCoy 2)Betts 3)F-Jax 4)Forsett ... thx!"
9148,@handle -- Maroney vs. T-Jones ... really? REALLY? What's with all the T-Jones hatred?
9148,"@handle -- OOO, tempting ... but I think I'd rather go the S-Jax route ..."
9148,@handle -- I'd rank your Week 11 RBs like this: 1)Moreno 2)Grant 3)Forsett
9148,@handle -- I'm just telling you how I would do it ... Crabtree's breakout is imminent ... and he's a low-risk play against Walter
9148,"@handle -- No matter the situation, I'm riding T-Jones and P-Thomas in Week 11 (over Bernard Freaking Scott) ... thx!"
9148,@handle -- I don't do the weekly projections (I have enough on my plate) ... but I would rather have Breaston over Santana in Week 11
9148,"@handle -- This is pretty easy, actually ... let's ride Crabtree and Burleson (who LOVES playing his old team) over Olsen & Walter"
9148,"@handle -- Thanks, I have enough TVs ..."
9148,"@handle -- Yes, I think I would gladly take S-Jax for B-Marsh and LT in a PPR league -- especially if Orton is out for 1-3 weeks ..."
9148,"@handle -- I'd go J-Maclin over your three TEs for Week 11 ... and yes, the Friday Clicks are already out ... thx!"
9148,"@handle -- During crunch time, I'm going to ride Addai over the Cincy backs ... just pray for 40 receiving yards and a goal-line TD ..."
9148,@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 (misspelled your Twitter ID the first time -- sorry)
9148,@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 .. thx!
9148,"@handle -- Have I not mentioned you before? OK, I'll get to you on Wednesday -- PROVIDED you send me a Week 12 lineup question ..."
9148,Here are Friday's Fantasy Clicks/Thursday Revelations ... hot off the presses! http://tinyurl.com/ylbnacu
9148,@handle -- Test my skill? Test my skill? 1)Knowshon 2)Grant 3)Caddy ... BOOM!
9148,@handle -- I would want Peyton/AP over McNabb/C-Johnson ... perhaps one of the best last-minute blockbusters you'll ever see ... thx!
9148,"@handle -- I'd go Jacobs over Bernard Scott ... and Breaston over Lee Evans in Week 11 (although I love Evans vs. JAX, too) ... thx!"
9148,@handle -- I answered the Beanie/Hightower/Slaton question in today's Clicks (to be published shortly on SI.com) ... thx!
9148,"@handle -- I think I'd prefer the Calvin/J-Stew side, compared to the Sidney Rice (and whatever you'd find on waivers) duo ... thx!"
9148,@handle -- MSW is AVERAGING 6 catches/113 yards/1 TD in home games this year ... I think the choice is clear ... especially against Walter
9148,@handle -- I understand your Barber devotion ... but I'm always going to ride the hot hand (R-Bush -- 5 TDs in 5 games) during crunch time!!
9148,"@handle -- If it's a PPR league, ride Housh ... and if it's a standard-scoring one, hmmmmm ... I think I would go Jacobs (by a nose), thx!"
9148,@handle -- My Fantasy Clicks come out every M/W/F ... and I do a REVIEW of each 'League' episode every Wednesday ...
9148,@handle -- I'm just telling you what I'd do ... you're under no obligation to follow the advice ...

6276,Phoenix rocks. ? 1901 - Phoenix http://lala.com/zEd
6276,Talking skiing and freedom with Warren Miller at brunch in Seattle. http://twitpic.com/pot1a
6276,@handle was too bad to miss you! Next time.
6276,"Crusing Pike's Place Market in Seattle with the @handle crew. Join us for tonight's showing of ""Refresh"" with guest Warren Miller."
6595,It's beginning to look like a 4-player logjam for the LF/DH spots in Texas. So far Byrd and Blalock are getting more ABs than Murphy/Jones.
6595,Wang v. Uehara matchup on Wednesday yielded ZERO strikeouts by the two starting pitchers. I can't believe that happens very often.
6595,Lineup lessons learned so far? Tony La Russa will tinker on a daily basis. Shocking! Read the April 7 Extract. http://tiny.cc/xPZFJ
6595,"New Daily Extract is posted, pointing out surprises in Opening Day rosters. http://tiny.cc/50lcr"
6595,"Peeking at the lineups in tonights Atl/Phi game - no surprises. Jordan Schafer batting #8 is just confirmation, not a surprise."
6595,"Definition of ""Baker's Dozen"" -- Number of fantasy teams on which I own Scott Baker. Aargh! (Shift everyone up one and add RA Dickey as #5)"
6595,"From Sabathia to Suppan on opening day: One small step for Jeff, One giant leap downward for the Milwaukee Brewers."
6595,Skip Schumaker to bat #9 vs. lefties and #1 vs. righties. That is downright weird.
6595,Some are calling it Devine-intervention. Brad Ziegler will be the closer in Oakland. If you picked him up cheap in your auction: Miraculous.
6595,"Nah. We'll eat your $14,000,000 salary this year. Nah. We don't care that you are on the brink of 500 HR immortality. Bye bye, Gary."
6595,"Despite my brilliant move of snagging J.A. Happ at auction for $1, the Phils are not playing along. Chan Ho Park will be the #5 starter."
6595,"Score another win for the Netherlands: with Hochevar sent down, Sir Sidney Ponson has a chance to belly flop his way into the rotation in KC"
6595,Gardner declared starting CF in NY. A new source of SB has entered the fantasy game.
6595,"News that B. Morrow will close in Seattle will send Lowe, Batista, Aardsma, Corcoran, and Cordero to the wire in lots of fantasy leagues."
6595,"Kris Benson may be in line for a rotation spot in Texas. Nice to see a Benson story without an annoying mention of Anna. Oh, sorry."
6595,Forget about Meet the Press and Face the Nation. I'll be watching Lou Piniella on Sunday to hear him explain why it's Gregg & not Marmol.
6595,Carlos Villaneuva will close in Milwaukee until either 1) Hoffman gets healthy or 2) the Curse of the Brewer Pen renders him ineffective.
6595,Girardi talks about a swap at the top of the Yankee's batting order: Jeter/Damon/Teixeira/Matsui/Nady/Posada/Cano/Ransom/Gardner
6595,"Skip Schumaker will start at 2B for the Cardinals, say GM John Mozeliak. Who woulda thunk this would happen one month ago."
6595,Can you believe this? Saunders/Weaver/Moseley/Adenhart/Loux may be the rotation to begin the year in Anaheim. Tex would look good about now.
6595,"Believe it or not, the Nationals rotation is beginning to look like this: Lannan/Olsen/Cabrera/Zimmerman/Martis."
6595,"Before writing Dontrelle into the Tigers rotation based on 4 shutout innings against minor leaguers, consider IT WAS AGAINST MINOR LEAGUERS!"
6595,Put me down for Franklin Morales as the fifth starter in Colorado. Making it Cook/Jimenez/Marquis/de la Rosa/Morales.
6595,The definitive proof that left-handedness by itself is a great asset is the continued talk that Horacio Ramirez will be a SP in Kansas City.
6595,"With Scott Lewis announced as #4 starter in Cleveland, here is how the rotation shapes up: Lee/Carmona/Pavano/Lewis/Reyes."
6595,"Micah Owings appears to have #5 rotation spot sewed up in Cincinnati, making for a tasty rotation: Volquez/Harang/Arroyo/Cueto/Owings."
6595,The Yankee CF battle is an interesting one. Gardner is making a solid case this spring. Melky has always struck me as a fourth outfielder.
6595,Mike Redmond is the #1 catcher in Minnesota until further notice. Who really knows if Mauer will miss one week or three months?
6595,Count on Shawn Hill to grab a spot in the Padres rotation.
6595,Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under: #baseball #mlb #lineups
6595,Scioscia says he is thinking of keep Howie Kendrick in the #2 slot in the batting order. That would be a big boost in HK's run totals.
6595,Chris Getz in as starting second baseman for the White Sox.. Nix to bench. Beckham to minors. http://tiny.cc/g2Ffm
6595,Blue Jays rotation suffers further insult. Janssen to start season in extended spring training or in the minors: http://tiny.cc/2EYtJ

39,@handle I was just charged three times for a game I decided to keep. Hope we can remedy this?
39,@handle Was it perhaps taken down? Or is this something more tech-related?
39,"Gamefly, I may have decided to keep the game I am currently renting, yes. But why are you charging me for it three times?"
39,That was a nap I needed.
39,"Every once in a while, instead of just shrugging off a complaint, I like responding with a comment that deflates the other."
39,Need to step away from the computer before I start yelling at my connection. Need to talk to roomie about whether the problem is the router.
39,@handle I wish I had invites. :-/
39,"Which reminds me. Do people want a L4D2 and AC2 Wave? If so, who wants to be part of the discussion?"
39,"@handle Maybe after I play some more, Corvus and I can have public Twitter discussions about it. :P"
39,"@handle Sorry I dropped from our earlier game; my connection kept kicking me then having a fit-start, then kicking me, et cetera."

39,AC2. Il Dottore!
39,Gnome!
39,Did I mention I love Rochelle? Yay for more black female protagonists in games!
39,Katana? Decapitation of zombies? Excellent.
39,There's a lot to like about the attention to detail in L4D2. Take an adrenaline shot and notice how the sound effects change.
39,Of course my internet connection wants to act up tonight; of course. Sigh.
39,Yay! First game I'm Rochelle!
39,@handle Billy Corgan is also insane now.
39,L4D2 decrypting. Guess I should go pop in AC2 and let it install as well.
39,It's okay. I brought a book.
39,I'm so rarely around gamers that aren't friends who indulge with me discussing games. This? This is strange.
39,"Then again, I know not what to expect at the end. Just a feeling I get."
39,I have a sneaking suspicion that I hampered some end-fight with allies with the decision I just made in DA:O. Made it anyway.
39,"@handle Also, realize I do not have your Steam name. Mine is the same as this handle."
39,@handle I was thinking much the same. Glad I'm going to pick up AC2. Hopefully up when I get back.
39,"Will go through first campaign, and then try AC2 for a bit."
39,"After I pick up AC2, I believe I'll come back and play L4D2."
39,Made a decision based purely on the fact that I respect Shale; otherwise never a decision this character would make.

2567,"@handle Thats the same as *#7370#, to be used on non-booting phones. at again, it does NOT reformat C: on FOTA+UDP devices."
2567,@handle FOTA does its job well. But FOTA+UDP makes this sick phone a brick. NO WAY for user to recover. That should not happen.
2567,@handle I think the FOTA design should be able to account for application bugs. Thats the whole idea!
2567,I assume they will have a way to reload the full factory image. Not sure how to proceed going forward; the bug will kill the phone again.
2567,@handle Nope. The hard reset only deletes data/settings it knows about. cannot handle bugs/corruption.
2567,@handle did you see my blog entry?
2567,"@handle Becase the reset just erases data it KNOWS about. the memory bug created unknown files that persist after the reset, or a re-flash"

4267,@handle - great question. The team.
4267,@handle - There are themes that are free. Thesis is not. It's a premium theme. themes.wordpress.net has many free ones.
4267,@handle - and I have tons of design friends to share.

4267,"@handle - funny, I was thinking something similar."
4267,"Just heard at my ice cream store: ""we don't have cones. They're coming in later."" Um...."
4267,"@handle - if @handle had his way, GateJumpers would have been our next book. I stole the topic for something new. : )"
4267,"@handle - should, but doesn't. API-related problems."
4267,@handle - Sorry we didn't get the chance to chat at the event. Nice to stand near you briefly. : )
4267,@handle - I think it's been an interesting exercise so far.

4267,"@handle - mostly because I like @handle, but also, in the early days, it let me make lists by adding instead of trying to load things."
4267,"@handle - that's just it. That's the issue, really. So far, my little town is little. I wouldn't want it getting microscopic."

4267,"@handle - not even close. But then, I change it."
4267,"@handle - right. That's how I prove I'm not ""famous."""
4267,"Technically, not a feeling of celebrity. More like.. ""oh crap, do I need to move my office?"""
4267,@handle - I *love* Cider Hill Farm. I take the kids there.
4267,"@handle - I said, ""I might be. Do I owe you money, or was I inappropriate?"""
4267,@handle - better than a Storm. Not sure about Tour or Storm 2.

4267,"@handle - I don't think Droid is it, but I think it's close. My take - http://bit.ly/5k5wpr"
4267,"@handle - beats me. People often say ""I didn't realize you were funny"" when they meet me in person. Odd, eh?"
4267,"@handle - the Droid thing? Yeah. Silly, eh?"
4267,I'm going to put together a business wish list for 2010. Why not?

4267,@handle - what? That old thing? Hardly remembered. ;)
4267,@handle - what would be unfortunate would be betraying my clients' trust. I might solicit so case studies.
4267,@handle - always good to measure. I didn't include everything. Just a sampler.
4267,@handle - I prefer making revenue improve.

9693,"can tell Tony Dungy basically wants to say, ""What the hell was Bill Belichick thinking!?"" #NFL"
9693,"still thinks after missing the 4th down play, New England should have let Indy walk into the endzone on the first play. #NFL"
9693,@handle Agreed. They should have let Indy walk into the endzone on the first play.
9693,Ok... I take that back. New England should have let Indy score on the first play to get the ball back quickly... not with 13 seconds. Damn
9693,@handle: Manning has to work with a short field instead of a long drive. New England will get the ball with some time to work with.
9693,@handle Forcing Manning to score on a short field instead of a long drive.
9693,@handle Belichick just forced Indy to try and score on a very short field by going for it on 4th down
9693,"even if New England turns the ball over on review, Manning has a very short field to work with and a point deficit.."
9693,thinks Coach Belichick has enormous grapefruits for going for it on 4th down...
9693,really doesn't like the idea of New England giving Peyton Manning a 2 minute drill with only a 6 point lead. #NFL
9693,hopes the Patriots respond in kind to that Indy touchdown. They definitely better not let Manning get them back into this one. #NFL
9693,loves watching Brady and Moss abuse Indy's defensive backs. #NFL
9693,has my Patriots shirt on and my Colts/Manning hatred at an all-time high... here's hoping for a mud-hole stomping by the Pats! #NFL
9693,is ready for the Patriots/Colts game a little bit later. Here's hoping the Pats CRUSH Manning and the Colts. Go Patriots! #NFL
9693,wants you to visit the photos from The Motions' latest performance at Egans: http://www.dsmithgalleries.com/g/themotions111409
9693,is happy that it's Sunday because that means it's the day of the Patriots/Colts game! GO PATRIOTS! #NFL
9693,wants everyone to point and laugh at the massive pile of fail that is the Auburn Tigers. HAHAHAHA! #SEC #CFB #NCAA
9693,"thinks two things were firmly established with this game: Our defense will not quit, and Mark Ingram is an iron beast."
9693,loves it when Alabama makes a team quit... especially when it's a team like Mississippi State. #NCAA #CFB #SEC
9693,thoroughly loves that Alabama's last two offensive plays were MASSIVE touchdown plays. #NCAA #SEC #CFB
9693,thinks Julio Jones was more wide open than the freaking Grand Canyon on that play. #SEC #NCAA #CFB
9693,is ready for another half of pounding the Bulldogs. Don't let up one bit and put these fools away for good! #NCAA #SEC #CFB
9693,absolutely loves watching Alabama just run wild over an opposing defense. MSU is going to be black and blue by the end of this one.
9693,loved the extra effort shown by Alabama's offense on that scoring drive... 7-0 Alabama! Keep it up Tide! #NCAA #CFB #SEC
9693,is very happy with the 1st quarter score of Alabama and Mississippi State
9693,really does despise Mississippi State. I hope Alabama shows them no mercy and gives them no quarter! #NCAA #CFB #SEC
9693,really despises everything about Mississippi State and Starkville in general. I hope Alabama humiliates the Bulldogs tonight. #SEC #NCAA

1564,And we're all in the same boat. . . Isn't that sweet?
1564,Isn't fun to be a professor?
9586,Correction: Simms equals his completion total since '06 (Had one for Tennessee last year.)
9586,Chris Simms' first pass completion since '06. Orton's return doubtful.
9586,Two Broncos have had more receiving yards in a quarter since 1991 than Marshall today. Any guesses?
9586,With maybe a little * on that first one. RT@handle QB Kyle Orton 4th Bronco to have two TD passes of at least 75 yds. in same season
9586,Josh McDaniels to wretches: We don't throw deep? (Impersonating Randy Quaid in Independence Day): Are you sure?
9586,"Only an overthrow prevents a third Broncos bomb for TD. Evidently, Redskins D-coord Greg Blache doesn't talk to his players, either."
9586,"Kyle Orton passing: 6 for 6 for 131 yards, 2 TDs and a perfect 158.3 passer rating. Yards per attempt: 21.8."
9586,Note on Lionel Taylor's two 40-plus yard TDs in a game in 1961: Both were halfback passes by Gene Mingo.
9586,Brandon Marshall is third Broncos receiver to catch two TDs of 40-plus yards in same game. The others: Lionel Taylor and Steve Watson.
9586,"Evidently, DeAngelo Hall and Fred Smoot were too busy discussing who should cover Brandon Marshall to, you know, actually cover him."
9586,"At FedEx, the Nos. 9 (Washington) and 3 (Denver) scoring defenses each give up a touchdown on opponent's first possession."
9586,Wait . . . hold on . . . was that a long ball? A 40-yard TD pass? Did Orton's lobbying pay off?
9586,Traditional I formation on first play from scrimmage with Spencer Larsen at fb. Good for 28 from Moreno.
9586,Broncos win toss and elect to receive. Evidently Josh McDaniels not taking coaching cues from Dan Hawkins.
9586,"Official game time weather report at FedEx: Seventy degrees, scattered clouds with a chance of field goals."
9586,FedEx half-empty for player introductions. Traffic? Security? Apathy?
9586,"Knowshon Moreno leads Broncos onto FedEx Field. Gotta admit, at first sight, I still think Darrent Williams."
9586,"Jerseys in line of sight at FedEx: Portis, Moss, Randle El, Riggins, Taylor (Sean), Green (Darrell), Arrington, Cooley, Haynesworth, Elway."
9586,Apparently Peyton Hillis isn't even helpful on special teams anymore. Inactive today.
9586,"Sunny and heading toward 70 at FedEx Field. Denver media seated behind end zone. So if something happens at other end, you're on your own."
9586,"Krieger: Snyder, woeful 'Skins on a ""trail of tears"" http://bit.ly/2LCDQB"
9586,Krieger: Deep ball high on Orton's wish list http://bit.ly/3JkMbo
9586,"@handle Thanks, Andy. And thanks for the help on my Avs question."
9586,"Evidently, referee Don Carey is becoming inured to turnovers. He just called a punt return an interception."
9586,"At the half, Broncos led Steelers 183-54 in net yards. After three quarters, Steelers led 253-222."
9586,"Rashard Mendenhall: 12 carries, 97 yards. Steelers running effectively on the Broncos' nickel defense in the second half."
9586,Kenny Peterson sacks Big Ben; Robert Ayers runs it in. 14 of 17 points in the game scored on defense.
9586,@handle Did you quote any anonymous sources from the Mustangs' win?
9586,"@handle Seriously, dude, where are you? We're scouring the press box. Did they put down the red carpet for no reason?"
9586,"That would be Kyle Orton's second pick and first actual turnover of the year (first was a Hail Mary at end of a half). Memorable, too."
9586,@handle Where is this expertise originating exactly?
9586,Ty Law's first snap as #Broncos' nickel back is also Broncos' first sack of Big Ben. Coincidence?
9586,Does Troy Polamalu get credit for breaking up William Gay's interception?
9586,#Broncos' first opening-drive points of the year. 20-yarder to Eddie Royal his longest catch of the year.
9586,Jeff Reed leads the Steelers out of the tunnel. No sign of a designated driver.
9586,So many invited guests on the sideline that Matt Prater had to ask them to pick up their coats so he could kick into his net.
9667,@handle sent ;-)

9667,Totally getting molested in the booth. Not really complaining.
9667,I'd rather have Jeb Bush play corner than Jarret Bush.
9667,"@handle I feel bad for him as a human, but dude fell off hard this year. Way too many dumb penalties. Not a shutdown corner anymore."
9667,Did I miss the part where Kampmann and Harris did anything this year? Kampmann repeatedly got burned and Harris costs us 3-4 penalties/gm
9667,Such a tale of two halves. We will NEVER win a SB with McCarthy @ coach. Dude is horrible. Almost gave the game back to the Niners
9667,Underwood is lost out there. Totally blew it on that last TD.
9667,I think McCarthy should get his challenge flag taken away. Dude's the worst in the league with challenges. Bring in Shanahan.
9667,The Packers have no answer for Vernon Davis. And at least Al Harris can't get a penalty from the locker room.
9667,@handle where's the live version of still ray from? that's one of my fav songs ever
9667,Thank you McCarthy for drafting Alex Smith and not liking Rodgers. Oh the irony. #packers
9667,Al Harris made a play without getting a 15 yard penalty? Maybe today will be alright...
9667,"Billick: ""shooting out of a canyon..."" Junior Varsity play by play crew today"

4914,"I feel like doing some night photography, but I don't know where to go."
4914,"@handle That's pretty much what I said/meant. It's kind of sad. They could have taken it/made more, but complaining is easier, sadly."
4914,"I like how people talk about how food in the kitchen is first come, first serve, until they don't get what they want - then they complain."
4914,"Right. I'm up for the day, earlier than expected. Let's hope this day goes a little better than yesterday, or I'm going back to bed for it."
4914,"Tried staying up, but I don't think I'm back to my full self just yet. Sleep time for me, and here's hoping I wake up early. Not finished."
4914,Cherry pie and South Park has a neat way of cheering one up after a not-so-amazing day. How random.
4914,I think tonight is a good night to go for a drive. Feel like I need it.

4914,New blog link up on the site I hardly advertise anyway; http://bit.ly/1Kak3z
4914,I just saw someone on Facebook comment that we should get rid of the ACLU. I'd laugh if they weren't serious. Now it's just frightening.

4914,I have a job interview at KMart tomorrow. What an unexpected surprise. My first job interview to boot. Well then.
4914,"Feeling quite disoriented, dizzy, tired... not quite sure what mood I'm in. I just know it's somewhere around good, and that I want food."

4914,Just got an amazing bundle of Mac apps for free. Check it out. http://www.macheist.com/ Let's get to 500k participants.
4914,"Right, bed time for me. Will try to sleep in. Might have some luck, as it's cooler lately, huzzah. Then more writing for me!"
4914,"I think I'll be heading to bed at midnight today. It's remarkable I managed to stay up so late, but didn't get much writing done. Oh well!"
4914,RT @ petapixel: Super weird - Dogs striking yoga poses: http://j.mp/3G0IYw
4914,I really shouldn't play loud music when people are sleeping... but I suppose I would have to care to stop myself from doing so. >.>
4914,Trying to talk to my congressman about this health care bill. Let's hope I get a chance to speak in the queue.

4914,"And now I think there's something weird with my entire ISP, as half the internet is slow, and the other half won't load at all. Sigh."
4914,"Finished with my site's small re-design. It should load faster and look a bit better, at least. Now... should I sleep, or not...?"
4914,"@handle Says you. >.> Oy, do you have an MSN or something?"
4914,"@handle It's not in the v4.5 code! It's... well, you think. >.>"
4914,"@handle Don't be jealous. I was sitting next to Pat as he coded it. Martyn, Ricky and Ryan can all verify it. >.>"
4914,"@handle It reads every post under that tag over your speakers in the voice of Jesus, and instantly makes you e-famous."
4914,@handle [arty][/arty] =P
4914,"Is it just me, or does seeing people double click on hyperlinks get really annoying?"
4914,"I just found out I get to take Christmas photos tonight. If you can't tell, I'm so ecstatic I just might explore. ...god I hate these. D:"

4914,I got a ubbc code named after me. This is awesome.
4914,I'm not sure what we're doing here. It's fun though. My friends are morons. Cheers all.

4914,I'm going out for a drive. Huzzah!
4914,"Just got back. I'm tired, and I'm going to take a nap before dinner. It was a looooong day, but satisfying."
4914,"Off to Black Friday shoppi - what? You want me to do the dishes, dad? Five minutes before I leave? No problem! Not that it conflicts."
4914,"So I'm supposed to get up for shopping in three hours, and I haven't slept yet. Maybe I'll lie down for a bit. ...haha, right. >.>"
4914,@handle I has a Gmail! We can chatteh.
4914,Two new photos on my #deviantart ; http://bit.ly/3RJZPS #photography #thanksgiving

4914,Alan Grayson is awesome. Many props to that guy.
4914,I'm being poked into writing a book on politics. That should be exciting. If only I had enough time to write everything I wanted to!
4914,"Well, today started out on the wrong foot. When that happens, there's only one thing to do. Go back to sleep and start it over. Yay!"
4914,Looks like payday is tomorrow instead of today. Let's hope PayPal feels like being quick in time for Black Friday.
4914,"Apparently they have Snuggies for your dogs now. Good lord, where's PETA when you need them?"
4914,Headed to bed now. Going to try to catch up to almost 100 hours without sleep. I wonder if I'll wake up in the middle of next week. Ha.
4914,"Fortune cookie says: 'Your courage will bring you honor.' About time, too."
4914,"I'm not sure what's being cooked for dinner, but while it smells delicious, it's powerful, and making me sick. Here's my excuse to go sleep."
4914,"Off to the bank for me. Getting my card and new account set up, then I get to come home, do some yard work, then normal work. Yey."
4914,Huzzah for a massive spider on my wall. http://bit.ly/5nSEdB #deviantart #spider #da #randomhashtag

4914,@handle I'll join you fo' sho'. And I don't need drinks to do it! I mean. >.>
4914,"Chocolate creme Oreos. The solution to any depression. Considering I'm not depressed, it makes for a pretty damn good mood, I must say."
4914,I just got Voice Candy for Mac for free from tap tap tap. They're celebrating the release of Voices on the iPhone http://bit.ly/i56Un
4914,@handle My sympathy goes out to you. I don't think I'll be leaving home until this hype dies down. Good luck.
4914,"Well, I'm home. Looks like everything turned out well. Now it's time for me to get some sleep and get back to life after that. Sigh."
4914,Almost ready to hit the road and take Kamicat to the airport. When I get home I'll either go to work or sleep. Let's hope not the latter.
4914,"@handle If you're still using any measure of logic or common sense to try to analyze women's minds, you're doing it wrong."
4914,Almost finished getting the car ready to go to the airport in a few hours. How depressing.
4914,"Well, calling the ISP didn't do much. Looks like a power cycle is my next and last option. How disappointing."
4914,"Actually, about half the sites I want to load don't seem to work. Looks like I'll get to call my ISP in a few minutes if nothing changes."

7935,Change what you read.
7935,Change what you daydream about.
7935,Change your negative thoughts to positive ones.
7935,"If you don't like what you are producing and experiencing, you have to change your response #E+R=O"

7935,"You only have control over 3 things in your life-the thoughts you think, the images you visualize, and the actions you take."

7935,If you don't like your outcomes change your responses.
7935,You can instead simply change your response (R) to the events (E)-the way things are-until you get the outcomes (O) you want.
7935,You can blame the event (E) for your lack of results (O) or ...
7935,"If you don't like the out comes you are currently getting, there are two choices you can make..."
7935,The basic idea is that every outcome you experience in life is the result of how you responded to earlier events in your life.
7935,Event + Response = Outcome
7935,The most effective formula for taking 100% responsibility is E+R=O
7935,All that matters now is that from this point forward you choose to act as if you are 100% for everything in your life.
7935,To be successful you have to take the position that you have always had the power to produce your desired result.

7935,You have to give them all up forever!
7935,"Taking 100% responsibility means giving up all your excuses, all your victim stories, all you reasons & all your blaming of outside forces."
7935,Are you willing to take 100% responsibility for your life?
7935,You either create or allow everything that happens in your life.
7935,Taking 100% responsibility means you acknowledge that you create everything that happens to you.
